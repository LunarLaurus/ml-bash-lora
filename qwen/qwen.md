Here is my lora project, analyse it and tell me what improvements can be made.
We are going to use full decomps of pokemon from team Pret to train upon, which are 100% finished.
Smaller models may be better suited for this task:

Design Document v0.2 — Legacy Codebase Knowledge Model (LoRA + RAG + Enrichment)    
    
Version: 0.2  Date: 2025-10-14  Owner: Team Red    
    
⸻    
    
0 — Snapshot / Objectives (short)    
    •    Produce a foundation LoRA adapter trained on the stable legacy C codebase that internalizes architectural and reasoning patterns.    
    •    Add a model-driven data enrichment step that annotates and summarizes parsed code (used to improve LoRA training examples).    
    •    Add dependency graphs into the dataset and training signals.    
    •    Later, use incremental RAG (index + retrieval) to keep the system current without retraining LoRA.    
    
⸻    
    
1 — Core Architectural Decisions (finalized)    
    1.    Primary model for reasoning & LoRA base: Qwen3:8B (recommended).    
    •    Rationale: best tradeoff for Team Red between strong chain-of-thought/reasoning ability, instruction-following, and operational manageability. Fit for a targeted LoRA adapter: small enough to iterate, large enough to capture architectural reasoning patterns.    
    •    Implementation note: use the model’s instruction-tuned variant where available; apply LoRA (PEFT) on top for cheap, focused adaptation.    
    2.    Secondary model options (explicit trade-offs) — pick one if Qwen3:8B is unavailable or you want a different trade-off:    
    •    CodeLlama (7B / 13B) — pros: trained on code, good code tokens; cons: reasoning may be less articulate than some instruction-first models.    
    •    Mistral / Mistral-Instruct (7B) — pros: high compute-efficiency, strong general reasoning; cons: less code-specific training signal out of the box.    
    •    Llama-series (Llama 2 / 3) — pros: widely supported toolchain; cons: larger variants cost more infra, may require careful instruction-tuning for best reasoning.    
    •    When to pick alternative: pick CodeLlama if you expect model to generate lots of new code and you value code tokenization; pick Mistral if budget low and you need excellent inference throughput.    
    3.    Embedding model(s) — separate from the LM used for LoRA:    
    •    Option A (recommended): an open-source code-aware embedding model (e.g., CodeBERT-like or Instructor-style instruction-tuned embedder) for code semantics. Rationale: embeddings trained with code data produce better retrieval for functions, signatures, macros.    
    •    Option B: hosted embedding APIs (if permitted) — often higher quality & simpler ops but external dependency and cost.    
    •    Choose based on privacy, cost, and expected retrieval quality.    
    4.    Indexing & Retrieval: FAISS or Chroma (local) for prototyping; Milvus/Weaviate for scale. Metadata filters must include repo, module, file_path, function_name, callers, callees, graph_distance.    
    
⸻    
    
2 — Pipeline Overview (updated, high-level)    
    
Main pipeline stages (scripts as individual Python steps):    
    •    01_index_files.py — discover .c/.h, collect file metadata → file_index.jsonl    
    •    02_parse_code.py — Tree-sitter-C parses AST, extract functions/structs/macro blocks & includes → parsed_functions.jsonl    
    •    NEW 02b_build_dependency_graphs.py — build call graph and include graph (per-repo) → dependency_graphs.json and node-level adjacency metadata attached to parsed entries    
    •    NEW 03_enrich_with_model.py — use an analyst model (can be Qwen3:8B running inference) to auto-generate human-like summaries, intent labels, change recipes, side-effect notes, probable callers/callees if not explicit, complexity metrics → enriched_parsed.jsonl    
    •    04_link_headers.py — match prototypes in headers to implementations, attach signature links → linked_functions.jsonl    
    •    05_generate_qna.py — generate instruction / response pairs using enriched metadata and graph signals → train_legacy.jsonl    
    •    06_train_lora.py — create LoRA adapter (PEFT) on top of Qwen3:8B (or chosen base) using the train_legacy.jsonl dataset    
    •    07_embed_code.py — embed functions/files and index them (vector DB) for RAG    
    •    08_query_system.py — retrieval + compose prompt + run LoRA adapter inference (API/CLI)    
    •    09_evaluate.py — test harness, metrics and human-in-the-loop QA    
    
Each script is atomic, idempotent, and produces a versioned artifact. Use DVC to cache outputs.    
    
⸻    
    
3 — Data Shapes & What’s New    
    
Parsed Function (core)    
    
{    
  "id": "repo:/path/to/file.c:funcName",    
  "repo": "repo",    
  "file_path": "src/.../file.c",    
  "function": {    
    "name": "funcName",    
    "signature": "int funcName(int a, char *b)",    
    "body": "...",    
    "start_line": 200,    
    "end_line": 234    
  },    
  "includes": ["..."],    
  "callers": ["repo:/...:caller1", "..."],    
  "callees": ["..."],    
  "graph_distance": { "to_entry_points": 3 },    
  "full_file_context": "...",    
  "hash": "SHA256(...)"    
}    
    
Dependency Graphs (new)    
    •    Include graph: nodes = files, edges = #include relationships. Store as adjacency lists + graph metadata file.    
    •    Call graph: nodes = functions, edges = caller → callee. Include call counts if static analysis can estimate it.    
    •    Graph artifacts:    
    •    dependency_graphs.json (per repo)    
    •    adjacency encoded for fast lookups    
    •    precomputed centralities (degree, betweenness) and top-k entry points.    
    
Enriched Metadata (model-annotated)    
    
Each parsed function gains:    
    •    summary (one-line), detailed_description (3–6 sentences), intent_tags (I/O, network, parsing, math), risk_notes (side effects, concurrency), change_recipe (how to safely modify), confidence_score (0–1 from enrichment model).    
    •    These fields are produced by 03_enrich_with_model.py and optionally human-validated.    
    
⸻    
    
4 — The New Enrichment Stage (03_enrich_with_model.py)    
    
Purpose: create higher-quality training signals and labels so LoRA learns why changes are made, not just what code is.    
    
What it produces (per function):    
    •    one_line_summary    
    •    detailed_description (3–6 sentences)    
    •    intent_tags (list)    
    •    change_recipe (step-by-step guidance to add/modify feature)    
    •    possible_side_effects (concurrency, state, memory)    
    •    caller_summaries (short list of callers + one-line notes)    
    •    complexity_score (cyclomatic or heuristic)    
    •    sanity_checks (unit tests or asserts to add when changing)    
    
How it works (workflow):    
    1.    Input: parsed_functions.jsonl + local dependency graph context (neighbors).    
    2.    Compose a structured prompt template that includes: function body, header prototypes, callers/callees, small context window of surrounding lines, and graph neighbors.    
    3.    Send to the analysis model (preferably the same base Qwen3:8B, run with moderate temperature for creativity or low for steadiness).    
    4.    Parse and validate model output into structured fields (JSON); add a confidence_score.    
    5.    Store as enriched_parsed.jsonl. Human review a sampled subset and adjust prompts/temperatures.    
    
Why do this: enrichment provides:    
    •    better prompts for LoRA training (context + instructions)    
    •    improved retrieval context (search snippets with summaries)    
    •    labels for supervised instruction-style examples (change recipes, why-to-change, etc.)    
    
⸻    
    
5 — Training Plan (LoRA specifics)    
    
Base model (final pick): Qwen3:8B (instruction variant if available).    
Why Qwen3:8B (TL;DR):    
    •    Good alignment with instruction tasks (helps in reasoning about code changes).    
    •    8B size is manageable for LoRA training on modest infra but expressive enough to capture architectural reasoning.    
    •    Balanced inference latency and cost for interactive queries.    
    
LoRA configuration (starter defaults):    
    •    Rank r = 16 (start); try r=8 for smaller footprint, r=24 for stronger adaptation if capacity and infra allow.    
    •    Alpha = 16 (scale)    
    •    Dropout = 0.1    
    •    Modules to target: attention q/k/v and MLP projections (follow library guidance for Qwen family)    
    •    Optimizer: AdamW (no weight decay for adapter-only, or small ~0.01)    
    •    Learning rate: 1e-4 to 3e-4 (tune on small validation split)    
    •    Batch size: as large as GPU memory allows; use gradient accumulation to simulate effective batch size 256–1024 tokens    
    •    FP16 or BF16 training (use BF16 if hardware supports and model weights are BF16-ready)    
    •    Epochs: start with 3–5 passes; measure validation loss and human spot-checks    
    
Data to use for LoRA:    
    •    train_legacy.jsonl composed of:    
    •    instruction/asking examples (from 05_generate_qna.py) that use enriched metadata    
    •    paired examples: (question about change) → (detailed change recipe)    
    •    explanation examples: (function) → (detailed_description)    
    •    small amount of regular SFT-style code completion examples to keep generation stable    
    
Validation:    
    •    A validation set of developer-style questions + expected actions (human-created and synthetic).    
    •    Hold-out functions & modules for generalization tests.    
    
⸻    
    
6 — RAG & Incremental Update Strategy    
    
Indexing:    
    •    Index both raw function bodies and enriched summaries.    
    •    Keep two entry types in index: function_node and file_snapshot.    
    •    Include graph neighbors as retrieval filters and to compute structural relevance (e.g., prefer snippets within 2 hops in call graph).    
    
Update cadence:    
    •    Re-parse changed files from commits; re-embed and upsert into vector DB.    
    •    Periodic re-run of 03_enrich_with_model.py for changed files to refresh summaries if desired.    
    
Query-time orchestration:    
    1.    Embed user query.    
    2.    Retrieve k snippets + relevant graph nodes.    
    3.    Compose prompt (top of prompt: user question; then ranked snippets with short enriched summaries; then structural metadata).    
    4.    Send to LoRA-adapted Qwen3:8B with reasonable max tokens and temperature low for deterministic outputs.    
    5.    Optionally run a short post-processing pass for step-by-step action lists.

7 — Prompting Patterns (enrichment & training)    
    
Enrichment prompt template (concise)    
    
[CONTEXT]    
File: src/foo/bar.c    
Function: int foo_do_work(int x, char *y)    
Callers: foo_init, main_handler    
Callees: helper_parse    
Call graph neighbors: [list]    
Source:    
<function body>    
    
[INSTRUCTIONS]    
1) Write a one-line summary.    
2) Write a 3–5 sentence detailed description (include intent, what it modifies, and primary side effects).    
3) List 3-5 tags describing the function's domain (e.g., "IO", "network", "parser").    
4) Suggest a safe "change recipe" (3–6 steps) to modify this function for adding a new feature.    
5) List probable risks and unit tests to add.    
Output JSON with keys: one_line_summary, detailed_description, tags, change_recipe, risks, suggested_tests.    
    
LoRA training example template (instruction SFT)    
    
{    
  "instruction": "How to add X feature affecting <module>?",    
  "input": "<enriched context: summary + key functions + call graph excerpt>",    
  "output": "<step-by-step change recipe + files to edit + tests to add>"    
}    
    
    
⸻    
    
8 — Evaluation & QA    
    
Automated metrics:    
    •    Retrieval precision@k (does top-k include true relevant functions?)    
    •    Perplexity of LoRA compared to base (for code distribution)    
    •    BLEU/CodeBLEU for structured generation (where ground truth exists)    
    
Human-in-loop metrics:    
    •    Developer usefulness (Likert 1–5) on a sampled set of questions    
    •    Accuracy of suggested change (developers try the recipe in a sandbox)    
    •    False positive/incorrect side-effect rate    
    
Release gate (example):    
    •    ≥ 75% yes in developer review on 50 sampled questions + retrieval precision@10 ≥ 0.7 (configurable thresholds)    
    
⸻    
    
9 — Storage, Versioning & Security (amended)    
    •    Data artifacts versioned via DVC: v1_parsed_v0.2, v1_enriched_v0.2, etc.    
    •    LoRA weights stored with version tag lora_legacy_v1.    
    •    Index snapshots: index_YYYYMMDD.    
    •    Security: All data and inference stays on-prem unless explicitly whitelisted. Enrichment operations should default to local/in-house models (no external API) unless a team decision is made to call a cloud model.    
    
⸻    
    
10 — Deliverables (updated)    
    •    parsed_functions.jsonl + dependency_graphs.json (M1)    
    •    enriched_parsed.jsonl (model-annotated) (M2)    
    •    train_legacy.jsonl (curated SFT dataset) (M3)    
    •    LoRA adapter (lora_qwen3_8b_v1) and training logs (M4)    
    •    RAG index & query CLI prototype (M5)    
    •    Evaluation report (M6)    
    
⸻    
    
11 — Risks & Mitigations (expanded)    
    •    Incorrect enrichment outputs: mitigate via low-temperature inference + validation sampling + schema validation; human spot review before including in LoRA training.    
    •    Graph extraction errors: use both Tree-sitter and optional Clang static analyzer for cross-checking; flag uncertain edges.    
    •    Model drift / staleness: LoRA is frozen for foundation knowledge; changes handled by RAG; retrain LoRA only if reasoning patterns must change.    
    •    Resource constraints: Qwen3:8B + LoRA is lightweight compared to full retraining but requires GPUs for efficient training/inference. Plan for batch sizes and use gradient accumulation.    
    
⸻    
    
12 — Hardware & Infra Recommendations (practical)    
    •    For LoRA training (Qwen3:8B):    
    •    1–2 x A100 40GB (preferred) or multiple A10s / H100 for faster runs.    
    •    Use mixed-precision (bf16/float16) and gradient checkpointing to fit more tokens.    
    •    For inference (RAG + LoRA):    
    •    Single GPU for test; scale to multi-GPU / CPU fallback for production via quantized weights or ONNX if needed.    
    •    Storage: SSD-backed storage for tokenized datasets; fast NVMe for embedding indexing.

14 — Next tactical steps (recommended, short)    
    1.    Confirm Qwen3:8B availability and inference environment (on-prem vs cloud).    
    2.    Implement and run 01_index_files.py on a sample repo to validate extraction.    
    3.    Implement 02_parse_code.py with Tree-sitter-C and produce parsed_functions.jsonl.    
    4.    Run 02b_build_dependency_graphs.py, inspect graphs, fix extraction issues.    
    5.    Prototype 03_enrich_with_model.py with a small sample (50 functions) to iterate on prompt & schema.    
    6.    Only after enrichment quality is satisfactory, generate training dataset and run a small LoRA experiment.    
    
⸻    
    
15 — Closing rationale & final model guidance    
    •    Final pick for Team Red: Qwen3:8B as the base model for LoRA. It gives the best balance of reasoning quality + manageability for your stated use-case (deep codebase reasoning and future use with RAG).    
    •    Embedding model: choose a code-aware open-source embedder if privacy is required; otherwise evaluate a hosted high-quality embedder if allowed.    
    •    Use enrichment step: it materially improves LoRA training by turning raw code into explainable, instruction-ready examples and will make downstream answers far more actionable for engineers.
